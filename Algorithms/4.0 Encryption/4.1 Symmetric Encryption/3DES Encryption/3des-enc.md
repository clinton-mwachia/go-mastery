# Triple DES (3DES) Encryption

This is a simple example showing how to use 3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard) in Go to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data such as credit card numbers.

## üîê Why 3DES?

While AES is now the preferred standard, 3DES is still used in legacy systems and some payment systems. This demo shows how to handle such scenarios using Go's `crypto/des` package.

## üìÅ Structure

- `3des-enc.go`: Contains encryption, decryption, and padding logic.
- `3des-enc.md`: This documentation.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Code

```bash
go run 3des-enc.go
```

### üß™ Output

```text
Original Card Number: 4111111111111111
Encrypted: TbnICv0ydZdw0Xf/+WQZSgH7AihnDK40
Decrypted: 4111111111111111
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

3DES is outdated and **not recommended for new systems**. Use **AES-GCM** or **ChaCha20-Poly1305** for modern applications. This project is meant for educational or legacy system purposes only.
