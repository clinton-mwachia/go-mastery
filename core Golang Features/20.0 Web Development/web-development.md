Creating a basic web server in Go using the `net/http` package involves setting up routes and handlers to manage incoming HTTP requests. Below is a step-by-step guide to building such a server.

**1. Import Necessary Packages**

Begin by importing the required packages:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)
```

**2. Define Handler Functions**

Create functions that will handle specific routes:

- **Root Handler:** Responds to requests at the root path `/`.

```go
func rootHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to the Home Page!")
}
```

- **Hello Handler:** Responds to requests at the `/hello` path.

```go
func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
}
```

**3. Set Up Routes**

Use `http.HandleFunc` to associate URL paths with handler functions:

```go
func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", rootHandler)
	http.HandleFunc("/hello", helloHandler)

	fmt.Println("Server is listening on port 8080...")
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

**4. Run the Server**

```go
go run main.go
```

Execute the program and access `http://localhost:8080/` and `http://localhost:8080/hello` in your browser to see the responses.
