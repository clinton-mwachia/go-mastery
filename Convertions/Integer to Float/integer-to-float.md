## 2. Converting Integer to Float

Converting an `int` to a `float64` is straightforward and does not risk precision loss, as `float64` can accurately represent all `int` values.

_Example:_

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    i := 42
    f := float64(i) // Converts to 42.0
    fmt.Println(f)
}
```

_Output:_

```
42
```

_Note:_ While converting from `int` to `float64` is safe, be cautious when performing arithmetic operations that may result in values exceeding the precision of `float64`, leading to rounding errors.

By explicitly handling these conversions and considering the implications of truncation and rounding, you can manage numeric data effectively in Go, ensuring both precision and correctness in your applications.
